# PasswordGenerator

### About:
- Just a simple way to get some randomized strings.
- This project was mainly just for me to test out some functions in Python ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
    - It's not the most efficient way to program a password generator, but it works.
- You can change the length, number of passwords, and what they contain, too.
